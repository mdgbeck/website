## About Me

I am currently working as Head of Reporting and Analytics at [ActiveCare](http://www.activecare.com/), where I've been since June 2016. There I lead a small team handling our reports for our customers, do business analytics, as well as internal research using medical data. I primarly do analyses using R, and use SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) for our external reports. I received a Bachelor's of Science in Statistics from Brigham Young University in April 2016.
